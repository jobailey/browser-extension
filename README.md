# Browser Extension

## Purpose
It may be intimidating for a beginner or even intermediate programmer to make use of developer features in software. But there are levels of developer software that can be reached for the average user who may not have extensive programming experience to make the most of for free. Microsoft Edge allows for this with the functionality of **browser actions**.

## Usage
***Geared toward Microsoft Edge browser settings***

- Open Microsoft Edge 
- Choose "More" icon
- Select extensions 

## Future Development
- Debug/troubleshooting 
- Incorporate more APIs
- Add functionality for sites besides **docs.microsoft.com**

## Dependencies
- (For Edge) Enable extension developer features in **Extensions**
